# Stackify
Full-stack web application that makes Stack Overflow easier to use
This application was developed in the Piazza hackathon.
This is a search engine that can be implemented in Stack Overflow and can make their search more efficient.
Currently Stack Overflow arranges its results using either relevance or number of upvotes. The application I have developed uses both relevance and upvotes.
There is also a dynamic statistics table that displays most frequent searches on Stack Overflow based on the tags.

In order to run this application, you must sudo npm install after downloading the folder.
Then you would have to type "node app.js" on your terminal or any form of Windows equivalent.
Afterwards on your browser, if you navigate to "localhost:3001" you should get to the site.

Thank you for reading! Hope you enjoy the application.
